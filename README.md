# AR_VR_Ecommerce
The project enhances mall shopping by integrating AR technology, enabling shoppers to virtually try on clothing and accessories in real-time with accurate size and fit simulations. It creates an interactive, immersive experience, eliminating the need for physical trials and making shopping more convenient and engaging.

### Functional Requirements for AR_VR_Ecommerce

1. Category Selection:
        The system shall allow the user to select a product category (e.g., Clothing, Accessories) through the console.
        The system shall display a list of subcategories or items within the selected category.

2. Item Selection:
        The system shall allow the user to choose a specific item from the displayed list.
        The system shall confirm the item selection and prompt the user for size and fit details.

3. User Size and Fit Input:
         The system shall prompt the user to enter physical dimensions (e.g., height, weight, chest measurement) via the console.
         The system shall validate the input to ensure the data is within a reasonable range (e.g., height between 100 cm and 250 cm).

4. Virtual Try-On Simulation:
         The system shall use predefined algorithms to simulate the selected item on a virtual avatar or model based on the user's input.
         The system shall provide a console-based description of how the item would fit the user, including any recommendations for size adjustments.

5. Product Exploration:
         The system shall offer the user an option to explore similar products after the initial try-on.
         The system shall display a list of similar products or styles based on the userâ€™s initial selection and size input.

6. E-commerce Integration (Mock):
         The system shall generate a console-based prompt or mock link to simulate proceeding with a purchase.
         The system shall display a confirmation message after the user selects a product to purchase, simulating the completion of the shopping process.

7. Error Handling:
         The system shall handle invalid inputs by prompting the user to re-enter the data (e.g., entering a height outside the accepted range).
         The system shall provide meaningful error messages to guide the user in correcting their input.

8. Session Management:
        The system shall allow the user to restart the shopping experience or select a new category at any point in the session.
        The system shall clear all previous inputs and selections when a new session is initiated.

This set of functional requirements ensures that the system is capable of guiding the user through the AR-enhanced shopping process.
